Review the code in files 01-print.., 02-print.., 03-print under this folder
Run the code , analize it ,  commment lines and see how the outcome changes
work with the code , understad it, and talk each other about the solution.
TAKE ONE  FILE AT A TIME- ONCE YOU ALL UNDERSTOOD ONE MOVE TO THE NEXT AND SO ON
DONT TRY TO READ ALL THE CODE IN THE OTHER FILES IN A SINGLE TIME.

After that:
  - Create examples at your own
    1.- Create a hash that contains hashes , and arrays inside
    2.- build a method to print the Hash ( DONT COPY THE ONES I CREATED)
    3.- You Hash should have an Array inside , so , create methods to push items
       to this inner array.
    4.- Print the result hash ( after adding elements to the array inside the hash).
